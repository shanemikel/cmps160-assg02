    Points Attempted:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Assignment draws a fixed generalized cylinder.  By default, the generalized
	cylinder should have 12 sides. </li>
      <li>
	If the user just draws a single straight, a generalized cylinder is drawn around
	it. </Li>
      <li>
	If the user draws a polyline, generalized cylinders are drawn around each line
	segment. </li>
      <li class="extra">
	Intersections between sections of your generalized cylinder are covered so that
	there are no "gaps". </li>
      <li>
	The user can save the model currently on screen to an OBJ file. </li>
      <li>
	The user can load and display a model from an OBJ file. </li>
      <li class="extra">
	The user can set the color of a cylinder. </li>
      <li class="extra">
	The user can have multiple cylinders on the screen at once. </li>
      <li class="extra">
	The user can delete a specific cylinder. </li>
      <li class="extra">
	The user can change the number of sides the cylinder has with a slider. </li>
      <li class="extra">
	The user can change the width of the cylinder with a slider. </li>
      <li class="extra">
	When you finish drawing a cylinder, print to console the volume of the
	cylinder. </li>
      <li class="extra">
	When you finish drawing the cylinder, print to console the surface area of the
	cylinder. </li>
    </ul>
